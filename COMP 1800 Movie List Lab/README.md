The .md extension represents markdown text syntax.
The markdown filetype allows users to edit text in ways that .txt and .html files cant do on their own, which is why github would be more likely to adopt it over the former two options.
.md allows users to display text in different typefaces, bolden, and create tables or lists just by using the markdown language syntax.
